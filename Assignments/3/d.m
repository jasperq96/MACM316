The Bisection Method will not work for this function because it is a double rooted function. This means that the function
touches the x-axis, but does not cross it. Bisection using the signs to determine which interval to decrease, but since its
a double root, it does not know which one to choose. Using it would be easy, choosing a proper interval is difficult.

Will always converge, but it takes a lot longer, and you would need to choose the proper interval for it to converge.
